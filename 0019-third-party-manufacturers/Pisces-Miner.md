### Apply to become an approved third-party manufacturer according to [HIP19](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0019-third-party-manufacturers.md)

## Generalize

	At present, LoraWan has become a solution for large-scale IoT data transmission. As its application area becomes wider and wider, more and more access schemes adopt LoraWan. At present, our Pisces mining machine and our suppliers have many years of experience in the development of Lora and NbIOT. We hope to help the community further optimize the functional logic of HNT through our years of experience in developing the Internet of Things.
	The types of HNT Miner working outdoors are not rich enough, and their corresponding parameters and specifications are not enough to adapt to more diverse outdoor environmental conditions. **Pisces Miner** focuses on solving the problem of outdoor mining machines, and has many years of experience in the development and production of outdoor gateways. At the same time, it provides Miner solutions that are suitable for work without wired networks and no power supply.

- Pisces Technology will provide customers with a 2-year complete product warranty.

## Hardware Security

 At present, our product provides the ATECC608A chip in the model design, which is used to encrypt critical user key information and other dangerous data to further improve product security.

## personal I.D

Private delivery of DeWi

## Budget and Capital

 We plan to produce 5000 in the first batch, but if the pre-order demand is large enough, we can expand the scale.

 At the same time, **Green Palm Technology Co., Ltd.**, as a company that has been manufacturing IoT products for more than ten years, has sufficient cash flow to ensure the normal operation of the supply chain

## Risks and Challenges

	 Our suppliers have decades of experience in the production and quality control of lora gateways. At present, our main production risk lies in the shortage of various chips in 2021 and the decline in the output value of Lora chips. We expect to solve this problem in the following two ways:

- Prepare inventory in advance
- Improve the performance of a single device
